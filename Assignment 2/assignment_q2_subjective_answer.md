## Raw Dataset
- The learning rate has to be reduced to 6e-6 for convergence, the loss values were overflowing for higher learning rates.
- Again, theta0 was not converging, but theta1 reached to its optimal value.

## Normalised dataset
- For this dataset model converged for higher leraning rate, 2e-3, with both the thetas within their optimal values.
